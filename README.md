# nlpExamples

This is a simple js file with some natural language processing examples, using the natural package.

Assuming you have node.js installed on your machine, the natural package can be installed from the terminal with the following command:
```
npm install natural
```

If you download the ```index.html``` file and run it in the browser, the console in developer tools will return an error. This is because the code is written to run in a terminal instance with node.
