# nlpExamples

This is a simple js file with some natural language processing examples, using the natural package.

natural can be installed with the following command:
```
npm install natural
```

If you download the ```index.html``` file and run it in the browser, the console in developer tools will return an error. This is because I am running this code in a terminal instance with node.
